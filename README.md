#  Creational Design Patterns in Modern C++
This repository contains practical implementations of creational design patterns using Modern C++. Covering key patterns like Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Prototype, and Object Pool, the examples demonstrate best practices grounded in S.O.L.I.D. principles. Real-world use cases and modern C++ features are emphasized, making this a valuable resource for intermediate to advanced developers aiming to write cleaner, more flexible, and scalable code.

## üìö Weekly Summary 

### Week 1: Introduction
- Overview of **software design fundamentals**
- Introduction to **UML** for visual modeling
- Deep dive into **S.O.L.I.D. principles**
- Preview of **creational design patterns**

### Week 2: Singleton
- Basic and advanced **Singleton** implementation
- Concepts: **lazy instantiation**, **thread safety**
- Alternatives: **Monostate**, **Registry pattern**
- Real-world use cases & **pitfalls**

### Week 3: Factory Method
- Structure and usage of the **Factory Method**
- Application in **frameworks** and **parameterized creation**
- **Smart pointers** for memory management
- Pros and cons in various contexts

### Week 4: Object Pool
- Purpose and structure of the **Object Pool** pattern
- Use in **games** and **multi-actor systems**
- Creating **generic, flexible pools**
- Benefits: **memory reuse**, **performance optimization**

### Week 5: Abstract Factory
- Introduction to **Abstract Factory** intent and design
- Applied in **database frameworks** (e.g., SQL Server vs. MySQL)
- Combination with **Factory Method**
- When and why to use Abstract Factory

### Week 6: Prototype
